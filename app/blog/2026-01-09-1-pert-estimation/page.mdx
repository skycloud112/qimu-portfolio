# Using PERT to Give Estimates When You're Uncertain

When estimating software projects, there are two scenarios:

**When you're certain**: You can confidently commit to a date. "Yes, I can deliver this by Friday."

**When you're uncertain**: Be honest about it. Don't guess a single date and hope for the best. Use PERT instead.

## What is PERT?

PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) is an estimation method that acknowledges uncertainty by using three estimates instead of one:

- **Best case (Optimistic)**: Everything goes smoothly, no surprises
- **Normal case (Most Likely)**: Realistic scenario with typical challenges
- **Worst case (Pessimistic)**: Murphy's Law kicks in, unexpected issues arise

## The PERT Formulas

PERT calculates a weighted average that accounts for uncertainty:

```
Expected = (Best + 4 × Normal + Worst) / 6
σ = (Worst - Best) / 6
```

The formula weights the most likely estimate more heavily (4×) since that's where reality usually lands. The standard deviation (σ) captures how uncertain each estimate is.

## Example: Estimating a Feature Set

| Feature   | Best | Normal | Worst | Expected | σ    |
| --------- | ---- | ------ | ----- | -------- | ---- |
| Feature 1 | 1    | 3      | 6     | 3.2 days | 0.83 |
| Feature 2 | 2    | 4      | 8     | 4.3 days | 1.00 |

**If Sequential:**

- **Total: 7.5 days**
- Combined σ: 1.3 days
- 95% range: ~5-10 days

Instead of committing to a single number, you communicate a range with confidence levels.

## Why This Works

1. **Avoid domino effect**: Communicating uncertainty prevents downstream teams from building plans on shaky commitments
2. **Sets realistic expectations**: A range prepares everyone for variability
3. **Reduces stress**: You're not locked into a single number you might miss
4. **Encourages discussion**: The range opens conversation about priorities and trade-offs

## When to Use PERT

- New technology or unfamiliar codebase
- Complex integrations with external systems
- Features with unclear requirements
- Projects with dependencies on other teams

When you're uncertain, don't pretend to be certain. Use PERT and communicate the range.
