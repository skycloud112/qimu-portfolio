# Using PERT to Give Estimates When You're Uncertain

When estimating software projects, there are two scenarios:

**When you're certain**: You can confidently commit to a date. "Yes, I can deliver this by Friday."

**When you're uncertain**: Be honest about it. Don't guess a single date and hope for the best. Use PERT instead.

## What is PERT?

PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) is an estimation method that acknowledges uncertainty by using three estimates instead of one:

- **Best case (Optimistic)**: Everything goes smoothly, no surprises
- **Normal case (Most Likely)**: Realistic scenario with typical challenges
- **Worst case (Pessimistic)**: Murphy's Law kicks in, unexpected issues arise

## Example: Estimating a Feature Set

| Feature   | Best  | Normal | Worst  |
| --------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| Feature 1 | 1     | 3      | 6      |
| Feature 2 | 2     | 4      | 8      |
| **Total** | **3** | **7**  | **14** |

Instead of committing to a single number, you communicate a range: **3 to 14 days**, with 7 days being most likely.

## The PERT Formula

PERT calculates a weighted average that accounts for uncertainty:

```
Expected = (Optimistic + 4 × Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6
```

For our example:

- Feature 1: (1 + 4×3 + 6) / 6 = **3.2 days**
- Feature 2: (2 + 4×4 + 8) / 6 = **4.3 days**
- **Total Expected: 7.5 days**

The formula weights the most likely estimate more heavily (4×) since that's where reality usually lands.

## Why This Works

1. **Honesty builds trust**: Stakeholders appreciate transparency over false confidence
2. **Sets realistic expectations**: A range prepares everyone for variability
3. **Reduces stress**: You're not locked into a single number you might miss
4. **Encourages discussion**: The range opens conversation about priorities and trade-offs

## When to Use PERT

- New technology or unfamiliar codebase
- Complex integrations with external systems
- Features with unclear requirements
- Projects with dependencies on other teams

When you're uncertain, don't pretend to be certain. Use PERT and communicate the range.
