# React Component Folder Structure

When a component grows large with sub-components, organize it in a folder where the folder name matches the main component name.

## Structure Overview

```
MainComponent/
  MainComponent.tsx      # Main component file
  components/            # Sub-components used directly by MainComponent
  shared/                # Shared utilities/components used by multiple tabs
  tabs/                  # Sub-domain folders (can be any grouping)
```

## Real Example

```
DashboardPage/
  DashboardPage.tsx
  components/
    DatePicker/
    useDate.ts
  shared/
    DataTable/
    DeleteItemUseCase/
  tabs/
    OverviewTab/
    UsersTab/
    ActivityTab/
```

## Key Principles

**Folder name = Component name**: The folder `DashboardPage` contains `DashboardPage.tsx`. This makes imports predictable.

**components/**: Contains sub-components and hooks used directly by the main component. These are implementation details of the main component.

**shared/**: Contains utilities and components shared across multiple sub-domain folders (like tabs). If `DataTable` is used by both `OverviewTab` and `UsersTab`, it goes here.

**tabs/ (sub-domains)**: Group related sub-components by feature or domain. The folder name can be anything that makes sense for your context - `tabs/`, `sections/`, `panels/`, etc.

**Recursive structure**: Each sub-domain can follow the same pattern with its own `components/`.
