# React Component Folder Structure

When a component grows large with sub-components, organize it in a folder where the folder name matches the main component name.

## Structure Overview

```
MainComponent/
  MainComponent.tsx      # Main component file
  components/            # Sub-components used directly by MainComponent
  shared/                # Shared utilities/components used by multiple tabs
  tabs/                  # Sub-domain folders (can be any grouping)
```

## Real Example

```
JobDashboardPage/
  JobDashboardPage.tsx
  components/
    JobDatePicker/
    JobDashboardTab.ts
    useBatchAssignmentWorkerIdsParams.ts
    useJobDashboardTabParams.ts
    useJobDate.ts
  shared/
    AssignmentsTable/
    DeleteJobByIdUseCase/
  tabs/
    ActiveWorkersTab/
    BatchAssignmentTab/
    CrewTab/
    GoingToJobWorkersTab/
    JobsTab/
```

## Nested Structure Within Tabs

Each tab can have its own sub-structure following the same pattern:

```
tabs/
  BatchAssignmentTab/
    BatchAssignmentTab.tsx
    components/
      WorkerSearchField.tsx
      DifficultyFilter.tsx
      EquipmentFilter.tsx
    SearchJobIdsUseCase/
      SearchJobIdsUseCase.ts
      SearchJobIdsAction.ts
      useSearchJobIds.ts
      _tests/
    ValidateWorkersNotBelongToCrewUseCase/
      ...
  CrewTab/
    CrewTab.tsx
    CreateCrewDialog/
      CreateCrewUseCase/
    CrewCards/
      CrewCards.tsx
      GetCrewsUseCase/
      CrewCard/
        CrewCard.tsx
        DeleteCrewUseCase/
        EditAssignmentDialog/
          EditAssignmentForm/
            GetAssignmentsTableParamsForCrewUseCase/
        EditCrewDialog/
          EditCrewForm/
            GetCrewUseCase/
            UpdateCrewUseCase/
```

## Key Principles

**Folder name = Component name**: The folder `JobDashboardPage` contains `JobDashboardPage.tsx`. This makes imports predictable.

**components/**: Contains sub-components and hooks used directly by the main component. These are implementation details of the main component.

**shared/**: Contains utilities and components shared across multiple sub-domain folders (like tabs). If `AssignmentsTable` is used by both `BatchAssignmentTab` and `CrewTab`, it goes here.

**tabs/ (sub-domains)**: Group related sub-components by feature or domain. The folder name can be anything that makes sense for your context - `tabs/`, `sections/`, `panels/`, etc.

**Recursive structure**: Each sub-domain can follow the same pattern with its own `components/`, use cases, and nested components. `CrewTab` has `CrewCards`, which has `CrewCard`, which has `EditCrewDialog`, and so on.

**Use cases alongside components**: Business logic lives in use case folders next to the components that use them (`DeleteCrewUseCase/` inside `CrewCard/`).

## When to Use This Pattern

- Component has more than 2-3 sub-components
- Sub-components need to share utilities
- You want clear separation between direct children and shared code
- Features have nested complexity that benefits from hierarchical organization
