# How to share claude.md with another person

Put the sharable claude.md (and the files it includes) in a git repo in Documents folder and upload to GitHub.

In "/Users/[username]/.claude/CLAUDE.md", add

```
@/Users/username/Documents/repo/CLAUDE.md
```

This will include the custom CLAUDE.md in your user CLAUDE.md (which is used by all your projects).

Ask the other person to do the same.
